  the App on devices you own or control, as permitted by the App Store Terms.</p>

  <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure your device and OS meet the App’s requirements.</li>
    <li>Back up your data. All data is stored only on your device; deleting the App or
        its data will remove your entries.</li>
